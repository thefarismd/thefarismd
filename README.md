# Hello World! 👋 I'm Faris!

🚀 I'm a web development enthusiast, eagerly diving into the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Bootstrap.

👨‍💻 I'm committed to mastering full-stack development, blending back-end efficiency with front-end aesthetics.

🌱 Each day is a step forward in my journey through the intricate and fascinating world of web development.

💡 Fun fact: In my free time, you'll either find me at the gym or horse riding, embracing both fitness and adventure.

📫 Feel free to connect with me at: [thefarismd@icloud.com] | [www.linkedin.com/in/thefarismd] | [https://wa.me/6593374545].

📄 Take a look at my repositories for a snapshot of my development journey. Feedback, stars, and collaborations are always welcome!
